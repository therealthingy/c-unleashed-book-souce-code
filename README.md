# Source code from the book "C Unleashed"

"C Unleashed" was written by Richard Heathfield, Lawrence Kirby and several
other collaborators and published by SAMS in 2000. It's a really good book with
lots of high-quality C code for various programming tasks.

It comes with a CD-ROM of the book's complete source code. While looking for
this code online recently, I could not find it, though from archived
`comp.lang.c` posts it was apparent that the authors made the code publicly
available. The main author's website at http://www.cpax.org.uk/ was supposed to
host it, but this website is down now. I also ran into sites that offer to
purchase this code, which was pretty annoying since it was originally offered
for free.

So I dug up my copy of the book and my trusty external CD reader and copied the
code from the book's CD-ROM into this repository (it's remarkable how smoothly
it worked on a 20-year-old CD-ROM).

This code is presented as-is, along with its original license (GPL as mentioned
in the comment headers of the source files).

Hope others find this useful! If you believe that this repository is infringing
someone's rights by existing, please get in touch.
